                        For an online store, customers not only come from one country but also from around the world. Creating a multilingual store, therefore, is extremely important. It helps customers do the shopping more easily in their own languages. Besides, the conversion rate is more likely to increase.

                      <p>
                        Have you ever created a product in Magento 2? In order to update the information of a product for multiple store views, you only need to open one page. Specifically, just open the edit page of the product in the backend. Then choose the store view you want to edit from the store view dropdown on the upper left corner. Like product, Magento 2 Shop By Brand supports this amazing function too. You can change the data of a brand for multiple store views all in the edit page of that brand.

                        <i><h3>Can I change the URL of the brand listing page?</h3></i>
                        <p>Yes, of course. First, click on Magezon on the admin sidebar. Then navigate to Shop By Brand > Settings. In the “General Information” section, you will see the field “Brand Route” where you can change the URL of the brand listing page. You can follow this link to have a clearer view.</p>
                      </div>
                      <div>
                        <i><h3>My customers have ordered some products of a brand but I don't see these products appear in the "Sold Items" management section in the backend? Why?</h3></i>
                        <p>First, we want to explain to you about Cron Job feature of Magento 2 which allows an activity to run automatically at a scheduled time. Among multiple activities that can be scheduled with this feature, one is refreshing report statistics on orders. Specifically, at a specific time of day, the order statistics will be automatically refreshed to include the most recent data. It means that you cannot view the most recent order statistics in the “Reports” section of your website backend until this time.</p>
                        <p>Now you may wonder how Magento 2 Shop By Brand collects statistics on sold products of a brand. In fact, our extension obtains the data based on the order report statistics of your whole website. If the order statistics of your whole website haven’t been updated, those of Shop By Brand haven’t, either. Therefore, if your customers have ordered some products of a brand but it’s not time to refresh the order statistics of your whole website, you cannot view updated data of these products in the “Reports” section of your website backend. And of course, you cannot view them in the “Sold Items” management section of our extension backend.</p>
                        <p>So, to view the order statistics on sold items of a brand, you have to wait until the scheduled refreshing time. However, if you want to view immediately, you can do it manually. Just navigate to Reports on the admin sidebar, then click on Refresh Statistics in Statistics section. After that, tick the checkboxes of “Orders” and “Bestsellers” (or you can select all). Set the Actions control to “Refresh Lifetime Statistics” and click Submit button. Now the data of recently ordered products of a brand has been updated.</p>

                    <i><h3>After installing Magento 2 Shop By Brand for my website, I want my frontend store to look like the demo. Is it possible?</h3></i>
                    <p>
                      Surely! All the settings you see in our backend demo will be the default ones in your backend after you install our extension. You can leave them unchanged so that your frontend store will look like our demo. Or you can make changes to suit your needs.</p>
